 1. Project Goal
‚úÖ "To automatically classify customer reviews as Positive or Negative using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)."

2. Core Methodology
üõ†Ô∏è "Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features, and Logistic Regression for sentiment classification."

3. Key Components
üîß Text Preprocessing:

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and lemmatization

Example: "AMAZING product!!" ‚Üí "amazing product"

üìä Feature Engineering:

TF-IDF assigns weights to words based on importance

Example: Frequent words like "the" get lower weights than meaningful words like "excellent"

ü§ñ Machine Learning Model:

Logistic Regression (simple yet effective for binary classification)

Trained to predict: 1=Positive or 0=Negative

4. Workflow Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Input: Raw customer reviews (from CSV or manual input)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clean: Standardize text format
3Ô∏è‚É£ Transform: Convert words to TF-IDF numerical vectors
4Ô∏è‚É£ Predict: Classify sentiment using trained model
5Ô∏è‚É£ Output: Sentiment label + confidence score

5. Strengths
‚úî Interpretable: Easy to understand predictions
‚úî Lightweight: Fast training and prediction
‚úî Adaptable: Can be extended to other languages or domains

6. Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è Context Understanding: Struggles with sarcasm or mixed sentiments
‚ö†Ô∏è Data Dependency: Requires labeled training data for good accuracy

  7.The Dataset we used in Sentiment Analysis.

8. Practical Applications
üìà Business Analytics: Track product/service sentiment trends
üì± Chatbots/AI: Auto-flag negative feedback for urgent response
‚≠ê Review Platforms: Filter positive/negative reviews automatically

9. Sample Output
Review: "Love this phone!" ‚Üí Positive (98% confidence)  
Review: "Battery dies quickly" ‚Üí Negative (91% confidence)
